# Project Description
SEAUTO workshop currently relies on an Excel document for managing work orders and tracking. The aim of this project is to develop a Work Order Vehicle Management System that replaces the manual process. The system will allow administrators to streamline work order management while offering clients a comprehensive overview of their vehicle's status and ongoing work, including pictures.
